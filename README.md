# 2023  Misogyny in Twitter

Can a woman’s career have an impact on the attacks she receives online?

## Report Abstract

This report aims at expanding the studies in literature about automatic misogyny identification in social media by investigating whether and in which measure women occupational fields play a role in the attacks they receive online. 

The described study is threefold: it expands the chosen starting data set comprising misogynistic and non-misogynistic tweets by adding newly extracted tweets provided with the indication of victims’ occupation; 
assesses a state-of-the-art classifier’s performance on the misogyny identification task, exploiting it to perform automatic annotation of the mentioned newly extracted tweets with respect to different categories of misogynistic behaviors; 
retrieves insights regarding the relationship between women’s jobs and the kinds of misogyny directed against them.
